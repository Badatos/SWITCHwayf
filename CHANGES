* Version 1.14.1 - Release date: 12. November 2010

    Thanks to Prof. Kazutsuna Yamaji for reporting this issue.
  - Corrected behaviour of $enableDSReturnParamCheck and 
    $useACURLsForReturnParamCheck. There won't be an error anymore if an SP 
    has no <idpdisc:DiscoveryResponse> extension defined. In such a case
    there will only be a check if $useACURLsForReturnParamCheck is enabled.

* Version 1.14 - Release date: 9. November 2010

    the Embedded WAYF on request of Wolgang Lierz. This
    option allows setting the remember for session checkbox to true
  - The 'return' parameter of a Discovery Service request can now be 
    checked using the idp-discovery-protocol extension or using the FQDN 
    of all the Service Provider's assertion consumer URLs. The latter 
    alternative is less secure but still offers better security against 
    phising attacks. Have a look at config.dist.php and the README for 
    more detailed explanations on these feature.
  - Metadata parsing now uses DOM XML for PHP5 instead of Simple XML
  - Fixed a minor HTML error in template for Embedded WAYF
  - Sorting within categories works now correctly if SAML2 metadata is 
    used to generate Identity Provider drop-down list.  
    Thanks to Prof. Kazutsuna Yamaji for reporting this issue.
  - Fixed a minor bug in templates.php that cause PHP warnings to show up
    in case an invalid IdP was stored in the cookie.
  - Fixed a bug affecting the Kerberos authentication.  
    Thanks to Robert Basch for reporting these bugs and for 
    submitting patches.
  - Fixed a bug where hidden IdPs would still be shown in Embedded WAYF
